# Obsidian Save Graphs Plugin

THIS PLUGIN IS PUT ON ICE FOR NOW

the reason is that obsidians graph API is not accessible at all and trying to do ugly stuff with saving the files does not even work in a stable fashion, its basically a one graph cache (since you need to restart obsidian to have it read the `graph.json`) that can be done manually when I initially wanted to be able to save multiple graphs.
